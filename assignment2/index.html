        /*
        What I Learned About Scope and Hoisting in JavaScript:

        In JavaScript, scope defines where variables and functions can be accessed. 
        Global variables are declared outside any function and can be used throughout the entire script, 
        while local variables are declared inside a function and are accessible only within that function. 
        This separation helps prevent unintended data modifications. I also learned about lexical scope, 
        where functions execute in the context they were defined, not where they are called. 
        This means inner functions remember variables from their outer scope, which is key for closures.

        Additionally, I explored the concept of hoisting. JavaScript hoists declarations 
        to the top of their scope during compilation. Function declarations are hoisted fully, 
        so they can be called before they appear in code. Variables declared with `var` are hoisted 
        but initialized with `undefined`, so accessing them early won’t throw an error, 
        but may lead to bugs. However, variables declared with `let` and `const` are hoisted 
        but not initialized — accessing them before declaration causes a ReferenceError due to the "Temporal Dead Zone". 
        Understanding these concepts is essential for writing clean and predictable JavaScript code.
